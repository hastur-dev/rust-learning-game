message: "Communicate between threads with channels! Master mpsc (multiple producer, single consumer) channels, learn about bounded vs unbounded channels, and explore advanced patterns with crossbeam."

hint_message: "Channels: mpsc::channel() creates sender/receiver pair. send() sends values, recv() receives. Channel closes when all senders dropped. crossbeam provides more channel types and select! macro."
