message: "Welcome to Rust's most unique feature: Ownership! Understanding ownership is crucial for memory safety without garbage collection. Learn the three rules and how values move between scopes."

hint_message: "Ownership Rules: 1) Each value has one owner, 2) Only one owner at a time, 3) Value is dropped when owner goes out of scope. Assignment moves ownership by default."
