message: "Master Rust Variables & Mutability! ðŸ”’ Navigate around obstacles to collect items about variables. Learn why Rust makes variables immutable by default - it prevents bugs and enables fearless concurrency. TO WIN: Collect both 'variables_tip' and 'mutability_tip' items, then grab the goal. This teaches memory safety without runtime cost!"

hint_message: "RUST SYNTAX: 'let x = 5;' creates immutable variable (cannot change). 'let mut y = 10; y = 15;' creates mutable variable. Immutability by default prevents data races and makes code easier to reason about. Press B to see full documentation!"
