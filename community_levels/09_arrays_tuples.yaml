message: "Explore compound data types! Arrays store multiple values of the same type with fixed size. Tuples group different types together. Both are stack-allocated and perfect for known-size collections."

hint_message: "Arrays: [T; N] syntax, fixed size. let arr = [1, 2, 3] or [0; 5]. Tuples: (T1, T2, T3) syntax, different types. Access with .0, .1, etc. or destructure with let (a, b, c) = tuple."
