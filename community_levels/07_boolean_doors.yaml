message: "Boolean Doors Challenge! ðŸšª Learn boolean literals by controlling doors. Navigate to collect items by opening/closing doors strategically. TO WIN: Stand on door tiles and use open_door(true) to open or open_door(false) to close them. Collect 'boolean_tip' item first, then reach 'goal_item'. Master true/false literals!"

hint_message: "DOOR CONTROLS: Move onto a door tile (brown â–ˆ), then use 'open_door(true);' to open it (becomes green |) or 'open_door(false);' to close it. Boolean literals in Rust are lowercase: true/false (not True/False like Python). These are the only two boolean values!"
