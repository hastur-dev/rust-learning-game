// Welcome to Rust Programming! ðŸ¦€
//
// You've just started your journey into systems programming with Rust.
// Rust is a language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

fn main() {
    // The println! macro outputs text to the console
    println!("Hello, Rust world!");
    
    // Key features you'll learn:
    // - Memory safety without garbage collection
    // - Zero-cost abstractions
    // - Fearless concurrency
    // - Cross-platform support
    
    println!("Let's start programming robots! ðŸ¤–");
}

// Fun fact: The Rust mascot is named Ferris the Crab ðŸ¦€
