message: "Create custom data types with Structs! Group related data together into meaningful units. Learn about classic structs, tuple structs, and unit structs. Understand field access, instantiation, and update syntax."

hint_message: "Structs: 'struct Name { field: Type }' defines structure. Create with 'Name { field: value }'. Access fields with dot notation. Use struct update syntax ..other_instance to copy fields."
