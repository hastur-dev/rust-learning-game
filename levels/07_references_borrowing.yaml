message: "Learn about References and Borrowing! Rust allows you to refer to values without taking ownership through references (&). This enables efficient memory usage while maintaining safety through borrowing rules."

hint_message: "References: &value creates immutable reference, &mut value creates mutable reference. Rules: 1) Any number of immutable refs OR one mutable ref, 2) References must always be valid, 3) No dangling references."
