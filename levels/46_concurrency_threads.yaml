message: "Enter concurrent programming with threads! Learn thread::spawn, joining threads, moving data between threads safely, and sharing state with Mutex and Arc. Master Send and Sync traits."

hint_message: "Threads: thread::spawn() creates threads, join() waits for completion. move closures transfer ownership. Arc<Mutex<T>> for shared mutable state. Send/Sync traits ensure thread safety."
